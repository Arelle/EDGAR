# EDGAR Arelle Plugin

## Overview
The EDGAR plugin, developed and maintained by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is designed to provide traditional and inline XBRL viewers for SEC filings. It also integrates with and extends the EFM Validation plugin, offering EFM validation for SEC filings. For end-user support, please contact the SEC directly at: StructuredData@sec.gov.

## Arelle Version
